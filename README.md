In my corpus, I would like to look at how much your 'liked songs' in spotify are represented in your 'on repeat' list. I find this an incredibly interesting part to spotify lists because my 'on repeat' list often doesn't match the songs I really like at all. I was wondering if the 'on repeat' list is compiled by indeed looking at the liked songs or if the spotify algorithm looks more at the listening time of songs. 

So in this corpus, I'm going to look mainly at my own "on repeat" playlist and my own "liked songs.  These two lists are, surprisingly, not even close to equal. Still, I do expect to see certain artists that I 'like' a lot back in my 'on repeat' list. 

Both of these lists contain all kinds of genres, artists, styles, etc. I have a very broad music taste, so it is extra interesting for me to compare my "on repeat" list with my "liked songs. With spotify users who only listen to 1 artist, I expect the two lists to be fairly similar and therefore my 'case' is more interesting.
